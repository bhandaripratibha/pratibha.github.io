  <h1>Pratibha Bhandari</h1>
  <p>PhD Scholar, Computational Data Science, IISc Bangalore</p>

  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I am currently second year PhD student in Computational Data Science at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc).
    My research interests include graph-based learning, spectral methods, and scientific computing.
    My primary research interest lies in applying mathematical frameworks and graph representation learning to analyze
    complex real-world data. I have also gained professional experience working with Foundational models in computer-vision, 
    particularly on agricultural image dataset at Corteva Agriscience. My previous research work includes incorporating 
    LÂ´evy noise in Stochastic Differential Equation for financial-data modeling.

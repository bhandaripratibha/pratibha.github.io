  <h2>3. Forecasting of Financial Time series data possessing Stable Distribution by employing Stochastic Differential Equation
  </h2>
  <p>
   My thesis project acknowledges the complex behavior of time series data, renowned for its inherent
 chaotic nature and inclination toward sudden, significant high jumps. To address such intricate data, the
 incorporation of Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) with noise can be done to accurately represent
 the data and its inherent traits. To better comprehend the distribution sustained by the data, the thesis
 explores the realms of stable distribution, which is majorly relevant for data exhibiting heavier tails.
 Therefore, this thesis highlights the utility of modeling white noise within the framework of a non-Gaussian
 distribution governed by L´evy motion. In this context, it proposes the use of alpha-stable L´evy motion due
 to its remarkable ability to closely mirror the data’s characteristics. Thus harmonizing the noise modeling
 process with the data’s intricate dynamics. This thesis aims at the techniques proposed in various research
 papers, discerning the most effective approach to analyze financial time series data. In addition, it also
 outlines the major improvements and future implementation in this domain.
